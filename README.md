This project built in .NET using C# implements Clean Architecture or Onion Architecture. This way implementing new functionality, finding bugs, or integrating a whatever software such as WebService, WebSocket, WebSite... is way easier than it used to be. I just wanted to give it a try and learn how it works to implement it in my upcoming projects.
